# Exploring-Affordances-of-Gen-AI-Models
We explore and assess how Large Language Models can reason spatial and interaction data through prompt design in order to connect users with LLMs to perform various tasks. <br>
<br>
Model used: GPT 3.5<br>


## Experiment 1: Assessing LLM reasoning for UI elements in HTML websites using small-scale experimentation 
We utilized the prompt structure proposed in <em>Enabling Conversational Interaction with Mobile UI using Large Language Models</em> by Bryan Wang, Gang Li, and Yang Li and benchmarked GPT 3.5's performance in summarization, question-generation, question-answer, and mapping instructions to UI elements to assess GPT 3.5's reasoning with UI elements in five static webpages with increasing complexity. Additionally we performed 0/1/2-shot prompting.
